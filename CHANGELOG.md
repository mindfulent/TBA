# Changelog

All notable changes to TBA will be documented in this file.


## [0.9.85] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **StreamCraft server mod not installing** — Changed `side` from "server" to "both" so mrpack4server extracts it from `overrides/` instead of `server-overrides/` (which mrpack4server doesn't support)

### Notes
- Mod count: 189 total (unchanged from 0.9.84)

## [0.9.84] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **StreamCraft Live** 0.1.11 → 0.1.12 — Fixed client crash on launch (payload types not registered with Fabric networking). Client now registers its own payload types so it works standalone.

### Notes
- Mod count: 189 total (unchanged from 0.9.83)

## [0.9.83] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **StreamCraft Live** 0.1.10 → 0.1.11 — Fixed client crash on launch (`ClassNotFoundException: HandshakeC2S`). v0.1.10's optional server dependency fix was incomplete; payload classes now properly duplicated in client mod.

### Notes
- Mod count: 189 total (unchanged from 0.9.82)

## [0.9.82] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
