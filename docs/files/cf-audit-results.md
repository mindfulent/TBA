## Approval Request Template

**For Fairy Lights Fabric Port:**

```
Mod Name: Fairy Lights (Fabric Port)
Modrinth Link: https://modrinth.com/mod/fairy-lights
License: MIT License
Minecraft Version: 1.21.1
Mod Loader: Fabric

Justification:
This is a community Fabric port of the popular Fairy Lights mod (originally by pau101).
The MIT license permits redistribution. The mod adds decorative string lights and is
commonly used in building-focused modpacks. Including it in our CurseForge modpack
would provide a consistent experience across both platforms.
```

## Notes

- The `packwiz curseforge detect` command failed with 400 error (API issue)
- Manual verification was performed via web search
- All "blocker" mods from initial analysis (Polymer, Minescript, AutoWhitelist, etc.)
  are actually ON CurseForge - initial analysis was overly cautious
