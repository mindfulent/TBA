## 🔴 RED - LIKELY BLOCKERS

| Mod | Issue | Solution |
|-----|-------|----------|
| **Polymer** | Server-side API, Modrinth-only | MIT license - submit approval request |
| **Minescript** | Niche Python scripting mod | MIT license - submit approval request |
| **AutoWhitelist** | Discord whitelist mod | Check license, likely MIT |
| **Gamemode Unrestrictor** | Small utility | Check license |
| **WindChime Unofficial Continued** | Unofficial port | May have licensing issues |
| **Camerapture** | Newer mod | Check CF presence |
| **Joy of Painting** | Check availability | Verify CF status |

## Bottom Line

**~70-75% of your pack is ready** - the core performance stack (Sodium/Lithium/Iris), building mods (Macaw's, Chipped), and major features are either on CurseForge or approved.

**Main blockers:**
1. Server-side mods (Polymer, AutoWhitelist) - need approval requests
2. Niche mods (Minescript, Gamemode Unrestrictor) - need approval requests
3. Fabric ports (Farmer's Delight Refabricated) - verify CF equivalents exist

**Estimated approval requests needed:** 3-5 mods
**Risk level:** LOW to MEDIUM
