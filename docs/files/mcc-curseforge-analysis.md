## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Automated Verification (30 minutes)

Run `packwiz curseforge detect` on your existing pack to auto-identify CurseForge equivalents:

```bash
cd C:\Users\slash\Projects\MCC
packwiz curseforge detect
```

This will add CF metadata to any mods that exist on both platforms.

### Phase 2: Manual Audit (1-2 hours)

For each mod without CF metadata after detect:

1. Search CurseForge manually for the mod
2. If found: Add CF metadata manually to .pw.toml
3. If not found: Check approved non-CF list
4. If approved: Mark for overrides bundle
5. If neither: Check license and submit approval request

### Phase 3: Approval Requests (2-3 days wait)

For mods not on CurseForge AND not on approved list:

1. Verify license is MIT, GPL, Apache, or similar permissive license
2. Submit via [CurseForge approval form](https://forms.monday.com/forms/a46faa60c3d9cf097763311811db5bbd)
3. Wait for approval (typically 3-5 business days)

### Phase 4: Export & Test

```bash
# Export CurseForge version
packwiz curseforge export -o MCC-curseforge.zip

# Verify structure
unzip -l MCC-curseforge.zip
# Should show:
# - manifest.json (with CF mod references)
# - overrides/mods/ (only approved non-CF mods)
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Mod not approved | Low | High | Find CurseForge alternative |
| Approval denied | Very Low | Medium | Contact mod author directly |
| Version mismatch | Medium | Low | Use packwiz curseforge detect |
| Review rejection | Low | Medium | Follow submission guidelines exactly |

---

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Automated detect | 30 min | None |
| Manual audit | 1-2 hours | Phase 1 complete |
| Approval requests | 3-5 days | Phase 2 complete |
| Export & test | 1 hour | Phase 3 complete |
| CurseForge submission | 1-3 days | Export ready |

**Total estimated time:** 1-2 weeks (mostly waiting for approvals)

---

## Recommended Alternatives (If Needed)

| If This Mod Blocked | Consider This Alternative |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Polymer | May not need if no server-side polymer mods |
| Minescript | ComputerCraft or scripting datapack |
| AutoWhitelist | Manual whitelist management |
| Fabric Seasons | Serene Seasons (if on CF) |

---

## Notes

1. **Farmer's Delight Refabricated** vs **Farmer's Delight**: The original is on CurseForge, but you're using the Fabric port. Check if the original supports Fabric 1.21.1 or if Refabricated is on CF.

2. **Axiom**: This is a premium/paid mod. Verify its CurseForge distribution terms.

3. **WATERMeDIA family**: The approved list shows "watermine" by SrRapero720 - this may cover the WATER* mods.

4. **Let's Do series**: These are popular mods, likely on CurseForge but verify 1.21.1 Fabric versions.
